## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security vulnerability in the library please email me at [chouse.samuel@gmail.com](mailto:chouse.samuel@gmail.com) or contact me on Discord at Xenfo#0001.

Once a vulnerability is reported, maintainers will investigate and take action on it. If a maintainer cannot replicate the vulnerability, the issue will be closed. If the issue is accepted there will be a security patch immediately or the patch will be added to the next version of Watcher depending on the severity of the vulnerability.
